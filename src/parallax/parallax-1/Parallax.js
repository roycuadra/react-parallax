        <h2>What is parallax?</h2>
        <p>
          Parallax is a displacement or difference in the apparent position of
          an object viewed along two different lines of sight and is measured by
          the angle or half-angle of inclination between those two lines. Due to
          foreshortening, nearby objects show a larger parallax than farther
          objects, so parallax can be used to determine distances.
        </p>
        <p>
          Parallax also affects optical instruments such as rifle scopes,
          binoculars, microscopes, and twin-lens reflex cameras that view
          objects from slightly different angles. Many animals, along with
          humans, have two eyes with overlapping visual fields that use parallax
          to gain depth perception; this process is known as stereopsis. In
          computer vision the effect is used for computer stereo vision, and
          there is a device called a parallax rangefinder that uses it to find
          the range, and in some variations also altitude to a target.
